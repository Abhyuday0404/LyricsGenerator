I want to be your vacuum cleaner,
Breathing in your dust.
I want to be your Ford Cortina,
I will never rust.

If you like a cafe,
Let me be a cafe park.
You call the shots, babe,
I just want to be your secret.

Secrets I have held in my heart,
Are harder to hide than I thought.
Maybe I just want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.

Let me be your lucky meter,
And I'll never run out.
Let me be the portable heater,
That you'll never be without.

I want to be your setting lotion,
Hold your hair in deep devotion.
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean.
Now I want to be yours.

Secrets I have held in my heart,
Are harder to hide than I thought.
Maybe I just want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
I want to be yours.
Bye, bye.
