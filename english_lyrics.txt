I want to be a vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust.
I want to be a vodka teener, i will never rust.
If you like your coffee hot, let me be your coffee pot.
You call the shots babe, i just want to be your...
Secrets i have held in my heart, are harder to hide than i thought.
Maybe i just want to be yours, i want to be yours.
I want to be yours, i want to be yours.
I want to be yours, i want to be yours.
Let me be your lucky meter, and i'll never run out.
Let me be the portable heater, that you'll get cold without.
I want to be your steady lotion, hold your head in deep devotion.
At least as deep as the pacific ocean, i want to be yours.
Secrets i have held in my heart, are harder to hide than i thought.
Maybe i just want to be yours, i want to be yours.
I want to be yours, i want to be yours.
I want to be yours, i want to be yours.
I want to be yours, i want to be yours.
I wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust
I wanna be your soft car cleaner, and i will never rust
I just wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
